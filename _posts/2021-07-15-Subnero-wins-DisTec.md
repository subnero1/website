We are delighted to announce that we won the [DisTec Undersea Challenge](https://www.udt-global.com/about-the-challenge).

The DisTec Undersea Challenge welcomed innovators and progressive organisations to showcase their solutions and disrupt the undersea defence environment as we know it.
Our team submitted a 5 min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkaCsabBDoA&t) about the Subnero Underwater Network (SUN), which saw us selected for the Grand Finals, yesterday, along side of Marcom Defence and [Seacraft](https://seacraft.eu/).

After a 10 min presentation from all the finalists, we were announced as the winner of the competition.
