We are delighted to announce that we won the [DisTec Undersea Challenge](https://www.udt-global.com/about-the-challenge){:target="_blank"}.

The DisTec Undersea Challenge welcomed innovators and progressive organisations to showcase their solutions and disrupt the undersea defence environment as we know it.
Our team submitted a 5 min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkaCsabBDoA&t){:target="_blank"} about the Subnero Underwater Network (SUN), which saw us selected for the Grand Finals, yesterday, along side of Marcom Defence and [Seacraft](https://seacraft.eu/){:target="_blank"}.

After a 10 min presentation from all the finalists, we were announced as the winner of the competition.

We are now hoping that the travel restrictions, to and from Europe, will be soon lifted so that we can attend the Undersea Defence Technology - UDT 2021 conference in Rostock, Germany, in December 2021
